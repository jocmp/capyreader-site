This policy describes the information that the Capy Reader app may collect and how that
information is handled.

Capy Reader only collects crash reports via [Firebase Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/) for users who opt in. Crash logs only include the stack trace of the crash, the app and device version, as well as the time and date the crash occurred. These logs contain no private information such as emails or IP addresses.
